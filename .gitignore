# Files from lib - 
#  Quick Note, every file in the directory 
#  of lib is private dependencies for main.cpp, 
#  that means it contains sensitive data that 
#  it can't be shared

# Because platformIO decided not to include the path of lib/* I had to forcelly hide the secret.h file.
# I include a example file updated with all the variables, just rename it to secret.h
